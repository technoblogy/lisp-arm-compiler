# A Lisp Compiler written in Lisp
This is a simple experimental Lisp compiler, written in Lisp, that will compile a Lisp function into ARM Thumb-1 machine code.

It is designed for use with my [ARM Thumb assembler written in Lisp](https://github.com/technoblogy/lisp-arm-assembler).

For more information see [A Lisp compiler for ARM written in Lisp](http://www.ulisp.com/show?4W2I).
